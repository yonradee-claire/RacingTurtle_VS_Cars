A fun arcade-style game built with Python and the turtle module, where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1) Make sure you have Python/PyCharm installed.
2) Clone or download this repository.
3) Run the game: main.py
** No external packages are required. Everything is built using Python's built-in turtle and random modules.
   
How to play this Game:

üöÄ Features
- Object-Oriented Design:
    - LittleTurtle: Represents the player turtle.
    - Cars: Handles car creation and movement.
    - Level: Manages the level display and game state.
- Collision detection using turtle.distance().
- Difficulty scaling as levels increase.
- Randomized car generation for replayability.

üí° Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Classes, objects, methods
    - Encapsulation and abstraction
- Game loop (while loop with time.sleep())
- Event handling (screen.onkey)
- Collision detection
- Modular programming (multiple Python files)
